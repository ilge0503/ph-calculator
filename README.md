## About

A program to predict neutralization titration reaction which studied and developed in "Haksung High School" for the "2019 Science Exhibition" in Korea.

## Patch Note

### v1.0.0-alpha

- Initial release

### v1.0.1-alpha

- We can calculate when [OH<sup>-</sup>] remains. (by assuming [H<sup>+</sup>] = -[OH<sup>-</sup>])

### v1.1.0-alpha

- We can now calculate weak acids, weak bases and polyprotic acids.

### v1.1.1-alpha

- We can now generate a Neutralization titration graph.

### v1.1.2-alpha

- We can now find equivalence point.
